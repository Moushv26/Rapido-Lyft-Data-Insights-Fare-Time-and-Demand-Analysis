# Rapido-Lyft-Data-Insights-Fare-Time-and-Demand-Analysis
This project analyzes Rapido &amp; Lyft ride data using Python to uncover insights on fares, ride times, traffic impact, cancellations, payment preferences, and customer ratings. It includes visualizations, statistical summaries, and KPI tracking to support data-driven decisions in ride-hailing operations.
For analysing the data, I have 
Calculated average fare differences, time differences, and distances by ride type.
Analyzed traffic conditions vs. fare, time, and delays.
Counted ride completions, cancellations, and preferred payment methods.
Measured payment failure rates.
Looked at surge pricing impact.
Computed completion rates and fare per km.
Generated a correlation matrix for distance, time, and fare.
Created visualizations (bar charts, heatmaps).
