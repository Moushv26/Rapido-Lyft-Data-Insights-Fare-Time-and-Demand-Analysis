ðŸš– Rapido & Lyft Ride Data Analysis using Python
ðŸ“Œ Overview
The Rapido & Lyft Ride Data Analysis project explores operational performance, customer behavior, and pricing patterns in the ride-hailing industry. Built entirely in Python, this project uses pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to transform raw ride data into actionable insights for improving efficiency and decision-making in transportation services.

ðŸ“Š What It Does..
This analysis examines multiple aspects of ride-hailing operations, including fares, ride times, traffic impact, cancellations, payment preferences, and customer ratings. The dataset is thoroughly explored through statistical summaries, KPI tracking, and interactive visualizations, enabling both high-level trend analysis and granular detail inspection.

Key calculations include:
Average fare differences, time differences, and distances by ride type to understand performance variations between Auto, Bike, and Car services.
Traffic condition analysis to measure how different traffic levels impact ride times, fares, and delays.
Cancellation reason tracking to identify operational and customer-related issues.
Preferred payment method analysis and payment failure rate calculation to evaluate financial transaction efficiency.
Surge pricing impact measurement to assess fare changes under high-demand conditions.
Completion rates and fare per km calculations to track operational performance and profitability.
Correlation matrix generation for distance, time, and fare to reveal underlying relationships in the data.

ðŸ“ˆ Visual Insights
The project includes clear, insightful visualizations to make patterns easy to spot. These include bar charts for categorical comparisons, heatmaps for correlation analysis, and trend plots to highlight operational fluctuations. The visual approach ensures that even complex insights can be quickly interpreted by business stakeholders.

ðŸŽ¯ Why Itâ€™s Useful..
This analysis empowers ride-hailing operators, analysts, and decision-makers to identify operational bottlenecks, pricing inefficiencies, and customer experience gaps. By presenting KPIs alongside visual patterns, it enables data-driven strategies for improving service quality, reducing cancellations, optimizing fares, and enhancing rider satisfaction.
